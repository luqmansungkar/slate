# Introduction

<aside class="notice">This is the continuation of the previous <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.bigflipv1.apiary.io/" >Big Flip API v1</a>. In this version, we focused on translating the language of the API to English. We also added several new API endpoints that only exist in v2. Starting from this version, we will try to only make new endpoints in English.<br><br>

This version is still a work in progress, so right now not all endpoints from the previous version are available in this version.</aside>

Welcome to Big Flip v2 API. Flip will help you in doing task related to sending your money, so you can focus on creating a better product.

This documentation will be updated everytime there is a change or if there is a new endpoint introduced. Every change will be documented in the [changelog section](#changelog).

I try to make this API and documentation to be as easy as possible and pleasing to the developer trying to implement this API. So if you have a suggestion or correction, feel free to send me an email at [luqman@flip.id](mailto:luqman@flip.id)
